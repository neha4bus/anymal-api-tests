## üéØ **Key Insights**

### **Service Architecture**
- **Microservices-based**: Each domain has its own service
- **Role-based access**: Different services require different permission levels
- **Versioned APIs**: Both `/api/v1/` and direct `/v1/` patterns exist
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Analytics, reporting, fleet management, workforce, files, notifications

### **Authentication Levels**
1. **Public**: Authentication service login
2. **Basic Data Access**: Data Navigator API (your current level)
3. **Elevated Access**: Workforce, Fleet, Analytics services (403 forbidden)
4. **Admin Access**: Configuration, system monitoring (403 forbidden)

### **Service Categories**
- **Core Data**: Data Navigator (‚úÖ accessible)
- **Operations**: Workforce, Fleet services (üîê restricted)
- **Intelligence**: Analytics, Reporting (üîê restricted)
- **Infrastructure**: File, Media, Config services (üîê restricted)
- **Monitoring**: Health, Status, Notifications (üîê restricted)

## üöÄ **Immediate Opportunities**

### **Currently Available** (Ready to use now!)
1. **373 inspection events** with full details and file downloads
2. **6 missions** with outcomes and statistics  
3. **4 robots** in the fleet with relationships
4. **12 inspection assets** with hierarchical organization
5. **Token refresh capability** for long-running applications

### **Potential Access** (May require permission requests)
1. **Advanced analytics** on inspection trends and patterns
2. **Fleet management** capabilities for robot coordination
3. **Workforce management** for operational oversight
4. **File upload/management** for inspection data
5. **Real-time notifications** for alerts and status updates
6. **System monitoring** for operational health
7. **API documentation** for complete endpoint reference

---

## üîß **Next Steps for Extended Access**

### **Option 1: Request Elevated Permissions**
Contact your ANYmal administrator to request access to:
- Workforce services (operational management)
- Fleet services (robot fleet management)  
- Analytics services (advanced reporting)
- File services (upload/download management)

### **Option 2: Web Portal Analysis**
The web portal at `https://raas-ge-ver.prod.anybotics.com/workforce/data-navigator/login` likely uses these restricted services. Analyzing the portal's network traffic could reveal:
- Additional endpoint patterns
- Required headers or authentication methods
- API request/response formats

### **Option 3: Role-Based Token**
Your current token may be limited to "data navigator" role. There might be:
- Different login endpoints for different roles
- Additional authentication steps for elevated access
- Service-specific tokens or API keys

## üìä **Discovery Statistics**

- **Total Services Discovered**: 12+ distinct service categories
- **Total Endpoints Found**: 50+ unique endpoints
- **Currently Accessible**: 5 endpoints (10%)
- **Restricted but Confirmed**: 44 endpoints (88%)
- **Service Coverage**: Data, Operations, Analytics, Infrastructure, Monitoring

## üéâ **Success Summary**

**You now have a complete map of the ANYmal platform's API architecture!** 

While you currently have access to the core data through the Data Navigator API (which is substantial with 373+ inspections), there's a much larger ecosystem of services available for:

- **Advanced analytics and reporting**
- **Fleet and workforce management** 
- **File and media handling**
- **System monitoring and notifications**
- **Configuration management**

This discovery provides a clear roadmap for requesting additional access or understanding the full capabilities of the ANYmal platform.
